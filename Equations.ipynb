    "The system considered is a highly simplified nuclear reactor. The system represents a single coolant channel along which coolant flows which is adjacent to a single fuel rod. All variables are either point variables (i.e. they don't vary with position) or are functions of a single dimension $z$, which is the distance along the channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coolant flows along the coolant channel at a constant rate and is assumed to enter the coolant channel at a temperature which does not vary with time. The temperature of the coolant is tracked as a function of the distance up the channel, as is the temperature of the fuel rod. At each height, the fuel rod is in thermal contact with the coolant and heat is exchanged between the fuel rod and the coolant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neutronics of the system are simulated using a point kinetics model, meaning the number of neutrons and delayed neutron precursors in the entire system are solved for but have no spatial variation. The neutron population causes fissions in the fuel rod which heats it. The distribution of this heating effect is determined by a constant power distribution function. The reactivity of the system is determined by a user-prescribed function of time and the spatially-averaged temperatures of the fuel rod and the coolant."
